<ul>
<li>That's the power of friendship! We childhood friends of Afterglow are invincible~! (Himari Card) 
<li>... The same as always, really. (Ran Card)  
<li>For us, the best we can be is the 'same as always.' That way we know we're still putting out the best music possible. (Tomoe Card)  
<li>Wait, wait, hold on! If Yamabuki Bakery closes... does that mean...? (Moca Card)  
<li>That's the power of friendship! We childhood friends of Afterglow are invincible~! (Himari Card)
<li>... The same as always, really. (Ran Card)
<li>For us, the best we can be is the 'same as always.' That way we know we're still putting out the best music possible. (Tomoe Card)
<li>Wait, wait, hold on! If Yamabuki Bakery closes... does that mean...? (Moca Card)
<li>Of course we're all great childhood friends, but those two have something special. On stage and off, they're like two bodies with one mind. (Tsugu Card)
<li>We have to go, before the bread disappears~. (Moca Card)
<li>Moca, Ran, the music... I'm glad it's all the 'same as always.' (Tomoe Card)
<li>... Let's do it! (Tsugu Card)
<li>I can feel the motivation flowing through me! (Himari Card)
<li>Come on guys! Let's do this! Ready? Hey, hey, hoh~! (Himari Card)
<li>It's not going to be easy. This is our dream performance, and we're going to have to work hard for it! (Tomoe Card)
<li>... I told you, it's got nothing to do with you! (Ran Card)
<li>I dunno. It's nice to call sometimes. I'm sure you'll feel all kinds of happy hearing my pretty voice, too. You already were? Well now you're 100 times more happy, I guess. (Moca Card)
<li>I'm rooting for you, Ran~. (Moca Card)
<li>Everyone else is still doing more than me. Part time jobs, and band, and clubs... I've got to do better, too...! (Tsugu Card)
<li>I just like it when people count on me for stuff~! (Himari Card)
<li>Come on, Ran, smile~. You know you're cutest when you smile~. (Moca Card)
<li> Is it a love song, about your dearest Moca~? (Moca Card)
<li>You don't have to worry about me. (Ran Card)
<li>It's weird not seeing her panic like this~. You're not buzzing enough, Hii-chan. Buzz buzz~. (Moca Card)
<li>Hya~?! S-stop that! Tickling me is not going to help~! Ha... haha~! Get off of me, Moca~! (Himari Card)
<li>I'm happy, I am. It's just... Seeing this guide makes it all suddenly feel so... real. (Tomoe Card)
<li>I've been making them for a while now, and I just finished the last one yesterday~... Tada! Himari's Amazing Charms! Take any one you like~♪ (Himari Card)
<li>Please, don't get sad, Himari-chan! I think they look really cute! Especially... Umm... Their, umm... (Tsugu Card)
<li>Hehehe, now we're all lucky-charmed together♪ Moments like these make me so happy. (Himari Card)
<li>We've gotta go make this Girl Jam ours. (Tomoe Card)
<li>The event may change, the location may be new, but we'll always be performing the same as always. (Ran Card)
<li>But I'm just not as good a performer as the others... I can't even bring everyone together like Himari-chan does... What exactly can I do...? (Tsugu Card)
<li>I-I'm fine! I'm really fine, honestly! Hehe, I'm sorry. I was just thinking to myself, that's all. (Tsugu Card)
<li>And then, and then! We make our major debut and start our new super rich and famous future~! (Himari Card)
<li>... I want us to be like this. The five of us, in our band. I'm not interested in making it big. (Ran Card)
<li>As long the five of us are together, I want us to stay just the way we are. (Tomoe Card)
<li>I mean, it would be nice to be super famous, but the most important thing is being here with you guys! (Himari Card)
<li>... Even so, Ran. All this talk of futures and the problems you have at home... How much longer are you gonna keep it to yourself? You have all these great friends around you, bonds 10 years strong, and still... (Tomoe Card)
<li>Everyone is improving so much... But me...? (Tsugu Card)
<li>You shouldn't push too hard. (Ran Card)
<li>I have to keep going... I have to catch up with everyone... I have to make this performance a success...! (Tsugu Card)
<li>Huh... That Tsugu sure is a hard worker. You could say she's pretty 'Tsugurific.' (Moca Card)
<li>You should probably be more Tsugurific yourself, Moca. (Ran Card)
<li>I'm way Tsugurific. I'm Mocatastic too, baby~ (Moca Card)
<li>That voodoo thing Himari made me, it's gone. I had it right here on my guitar case~. (Moca Card)
<li>I'll run to the studio for rehearsals. They've probably all started without me... (Tsugu Card)
<li>Huh...? I... I can't move... my body... No, no please... I have to get to practice... I have to... (Tsugu Card)
<li>...! Tsugu! Oi, Tsugumi!! Himari, call an ambulance! Quick! (Tomoe Card)
<li>... Ah. It's raining. And I didn't bring my umbrella~. This is all because I lost that lucky charm~. Not that I could fight the rain off with it anyway, but still... (Moca Card)
<li>... Wow. ... No rehearsal today, then. (Moca Card)
<li>I saw her fall and... my mind just went blank... Hearing you shout for the ambulance snapped me out of it, but.. I completely panicked. That's no good at all... I need to do better. I could see she was tired recently... I should have told her to rest more... (Himari Card)
<li>You know more than anyone, Himari. I'm not as strong as people think. (Tomoe Card)
<li>Himari, I was just so glad to have you by my side. (Tomoe Card)
<li>H-Hyuu~~! T-Tomoe~! Stop pulling my cheeks~! (Himari Card)
<li>Hmph~! Stupid Tomoe~! (Himari Card)
<li>This is not some 'fantasy,' and you have no right to say that to me! I am not quitting my band, not ever. (Ran Card)
<li>Just being rebellious... Maybe he's right... (Ran Card)
<li>... She hasn't been up on the roof much at all recently. (Tomoe Card)
<li>I'm used to getting shouted at alone. It's all I hear at home. (Ran Card)
<li>I don't think what we're doing is just some fantasy. And I'm not going to give up. And I'm not going to do flower arranging, either...! (Ran Card)
<li>Okay... I'll be waiting. (Moca Card)
<li>They said you spent all day on the roof, not even going to classes... (Himari Card)
<li>Well don't be. So what if I am skipping classes? It's none of your business! (Ran Card)
<li>That's not fair, Ran. We're all just worried- (Tomoe Card)
<li>How dare you say that to us! You have no idea just how worried we all are, do you?! (Tomoe Card)
<li>... We're friends, aren't we? We're supposed to know you better than anyone. (Tomoe Card)
<li>But you don't tell us anything! You don't let us in...! (Tomoe Card)
<li>... I'm sorry. I went too far. (Tomoe Card)
<li>Moca...! They all left... ... Wh-what am I supposed to do...? (Himari Card)
<li>... I'm really sorry. I'm the worst. (Tomoe Card)
<li>I never noticed how long the walk back home is, until I walked it on my own... (Himari Card)
<li>... We'll perform together again though, right...? (Himari Card)
<li>I couldn't do anything to keep everyone together tonight... And I call myself leader... It's laughable. (Himari Card)
<li>I... I always listen to her problems... and I try to do what I can to make her feel less stressed... (Moca Card)
<li>I... I don't want her to quit the band. I want her to always be with us, so... I want her to face her problems at home... but that's just me... (Moca Card)
<li>If I do fall out and smash into tiny little pieces, scatter them over the ocean for me~. (Moca Card)
<li>It is great being so cute~. (Moca Card)
<li>What a sunset. (Tomoe Card)
<li>I'm still thinking of the others. I guess when you spend as much time together as we have... (Tomoe Card)
<li>Hey, Himari? The sunset looks beautiful right now. Take a look... Oh, you already were? Haha... just the same as me. (Tomoe Card)
<li>There was our sound, and then the sound of the crowd, all mixed in together... It was like the song had come alive... (Ran Card)
<li>I think we all felt something after that show~. We all sat here crying together, watching the sun set. Hii-chan shouting 'I'll never forget this moment!' and stuff. (Moca Card)
<li>I never forgot it either. That show, that sunset... Even everyone's faces, all crying together. (Ran Card)
<li>... I guess we were all kids back then~. (Moca Card)
<li>I hope we can all watch the sunset again together some day... (Ran Card)
<li>I want to stay with this band. I don't want to give up. (Ran Card)
<li>I have been running away... from my dad, from flower arranging... even from the band. (Ran Card)
<li>... It's so easy saying all of this in front of you, Moca. Why can't I say it to other people, too? (Ran Card)
<li>Thanks, Moca. You know... for always being there. (Ran Card)
<li>I feed on compliments, you know~. (Moca Card)
<li>I guess tomorrow's gonna be sunny then... I think it'll be a good day, Ran. (Moca Card)
<li>We're just glad to see you're okay, Tsugu! (Himari Card)
<li>That's why we started the band in the first place... so we could always be together. (Tsugu Card)
<li>... It's just not the same without the five of us together. (Himari Card)
<li>The first sunset we saw up there after starting the band was just so pretty, we decided that would be our name - Afterglow. (Himari Card)
<li>We really didn't know anything when we first started out... but that was part of the fun, wasn't it? The five of us experiencing something new, together... (Tsugu Card)
<li>But if... if the band really is making her feel this way, then... maybe we should all think about quitting... (Tsugu Card)
<li>I love performing with everyone, but... it's not worth making Ran feel terrible for... (Tsugu Card)
<li>I don't want her to suffer any more either. Seeing Ran's face after what I said to her the other day... Well, I just don't want it to happen again. (Tomoe Card)
<li>I think it's so sad, but... if it'll help Ran, then maybe we should take a break… (Himari Card)
<li>... I-it's been a while since we were all together, huh. (Himari Card)
<li>I'm a genius~. (Moca Card)
<li>But every time we gather for practice, you look like you're being torn apart by something. (Tomoe Card)
<li>We don't want to do this if it's hurting you, Ran. (Tomoe Card)
<li>No!! I don't want to quit the band!! (Ran Card)
<li>I don't... want to quit... (Ran Card)
<li>Ran ... you're a coward. (Moca Card)
<li>If you've got something to say, then say it~. You can't just keep running away like this. I'd call that cowardly. Wouldn't you~? (Moca Card)
<li>You... erm... idiot. (Moca Card)
<li>If you can't even face Tomo-chin... can't even face any of us, there's no way you'll ever face your father. You coward. You chicken. (Moca Card)
<li>What...? Who are you calling idiot?! At least I don't just speak whatever nonsense comes into my head all day long! (Ran Card)
<li>Nonsense~? You don't speak at all, you never tell us your true feelings, but you're gonna say I speak nonsense~? Idiot, i~diot. And, erm... fool. (Moca Card)
<li>I'm sorry. I shouldn't have run away like that... But I really do want to keep playing with you guys. I never want to quit the band. (Ran Card)
<li>I... I want us to all watch that sunset, like after our first live show. Again and again, the five of us together... (Ran Card)
<li>Ahh~. All this fighting's made me hungry~. Let's stop by the bakery on our way home. The sweet buns should be on sale today~. (Moca Card)
<li>Come on then, let's go. Back to 'the same as always.' (Tomoe Card)
<li>... You're the worst, Moca. (Ran Card)
<li>... Go get 'em, Ran. (Moca Card)
<li>We just have to trust her. (Tomoe Card)
<li>Dad. I am not going to quit the band... ever. You might call it our 'band fantasy,' but we are absolutely serious about it. (Ran Card)
<li>Do you see this band here, 'Afterglow'? That's us... and I want you to come and see us play. (Ran Card)
<li>... Ran~? Your eyes are red~. Were you crying like a baby~? (Moca Card)
<li>I'm so glad we can still play together, Ran. Afterglow just wouldn't be the same without the five of us! (Himari Card)
<li>... Wow, look at that! A beautiful sunset! (Tsugu Card)
<li>Ran...! We should be thanking you! It's your music that brings this band together, after all. (Himari Card)
<li>Let's all make a wish on the sunset! I wish that our live show goes perfectly~! (Himari Card)
<li>It is a relief though. We're finally back to the same as always. (Tsugu Card)
<li>We'll put on the best performance we can. For Ran... no, for all five of us. (Tomoe Card)
<li>I'm glad we got to see the sunset together again. (Moca Card)
<li>... It's good to be home, Moca. (Ran Card)
<li>I want them to understand my true feelings... and I'll do everything I can to make it happen. (Ran Card)
<li>I'm not saying it's bad~. I'm saying you must be all grown up, to write a song like this, Ran~. I like it~. (Moca Card)
<li>I think it will be worth it. I think this is the song to show my... no, to show our true feelings! (Ran Card)
<li>Tsugurific... Tsugu being Tsugurific...? Ahh, I don't even know who I am any more~! (Tsugu Card)
<li>I guess this show's a lot different to all the others. The scale of it all, for one thing. But the emotion, too. (Tomoe Card)
<li>Okay! Leader Himari! (Himari Card)
<li>Ahh... Phew... I'm okay...! It's all okay...! Same as always, same as always...! (Tsugu Card)
<li>I'll teach you a great trick, Tsugu. All you need to do is picture the whole audience as different types of bread~. (Moca Card)
<li>Fufu~. Your face looks all round and delicious too, Hii-chan~. (Moca Card)
<li>I sort of lost my way recently... but these girls helped me find myself again. It's because of these four that I'm standing here today. (Ran Card)
<li>Look look~. I found Hii-chan's lucky thingie I thought I lost~ ... Maybe it's what kept our friendship strong through all of this~. (Moca Card)
<li>Stay the same... I think I've been so against change, even the word itself has become kind of scary. (Ran Card)
<li>A whole new Afterglow~! (Himari Card)
<li>I feel like I've changed... like we've all changed. I think a new Afterglow was born today. (Ran Card)
<li>Afterglow shows just how much we can change, while all staying the same. It's... something we should cherish. (Ran Card)
<li>Forever and ever, the five of us together! (Himari Card)
<li>Forming the band, taking part in Girl Jam, and now aiming for the Budokan... they were all your ideas, Tsugumi. You always start us off on something new. (Ran Card)
<li>As long as we've got Tsugu with us, I'm sure this band will achieve great things. (Tomoe Card)
<li>Fufu. You've really changed, Ran~. (Himari Card)
<li>Welp, you heard the woman. Let's have ourselves a show with a new song. (Moca Card)
<li>Hii-chan, you're not gonna do the thing? (Moca Card)
<li>H-hey, hey, hoh~... No? (Tsugu Card)
<li>It's been a while since the five of us have been in the studio together! (Tomoe Card)
<li>Does she not realize? There's a reason your lyrics can't reach us. (Moca Card)
<li>When I read the lyrics, I kinda got a sad vibe from them. The melody is upbeat, but something just makes me feel blue... Like this part about the flowers blooming and falling being a cycle. (Tomoe Card)
<li>I'd be happy to give you a hand. Just let me know if there's anything I can do. (Tsugu Card)
<li>I hope it's not that she's dealing with something and keeping it to herself again... You know she likes to stay quiet about that kind of stuff. (Himari Card)
<li>It's just that we've never been stumped when it comes to Ran's lyrics before. It makes me worry~... (Himari Card)
<li>If only we could see inside Ran's mind~. (Moca Card)
<li>What is it that's keeping the others from understanding the lyrics? (Ran Card)
<li>And with that, I sleep. Wake me up in 20~. (Moca Card)
<li>She's been putting so much time into flower arranging. That's something of note to us, but right now, it just seems normal to Ran. (Moca Card)
<li>Is this still our 'same as always'? (Himari Card)
<li>... You've changed, Ran. (Himari Card)
<li>... Yeah. I have changed. (Ran Card)
<li>So, what?! You wish I didn't?! You want things to be like old times?! Should I be a part of the band just so that I can run away from my problems at home instead?! (Ran Card)
<li>I'm doing what I can so that we can stay together... Why...? Why would you say something like that? (Ran Card)
<li>I realized that Ran changed, but I didn't say anything... Tsugu wanted to chase after her, but I stopped her... There has to be a reason I made these decisions... What are they? (Moca Card)
<li>I had thought that with all the things we were doing as Afterglow that I was growing as a person. But that actually wasn't true. Ran was the only one moving forward... Meanwhile, I was stuck in the same old place being the same old Himari. (Himari Card)
<li>Ran fought and fought, just so that the band could keep going. She faced her problems head-on. She changed herself so that everything else could continue to be the same... But what have I done? (Tomoe Card)
<li>What exactly have I been able to do for the band? (Tomoe Card)
<li>Yeah, we all lent her our strength, but in the end, she was the only one who had to struggle through hard times. We encouraged her to change... and we just looked on. (Tomoe Card)
<li>We supported Ran-chan and gave her the push she needed... At least, that was the idea... (Tsugu Card)
<li>If we wanna get closer to her lyrics, then we... we have to change too. No doubt about it. (Tomoe Card)
<li>I'll try my hardest to catch up to Ran. I mean, Afterglow is gonna be together forever, right? (Himari Card)
<li>I guess I haven't changed at all, huh? (Ran Card)
<li>No, you have changed. And you've reached a place we don't even know about yet. (Moca Card)
<li>You may not have realized it, but with all those things you're doing, like trying your best to make everything work out at home... That has opened your eyes to parts of the world that we're probably unaware of... (Moca Card)
<li>If this was how things were gonna end up... then maybe it would have been better if I didn't change... (Ran Card)
<li>You guys... Where are you? What can you see? Tell me... Please... (Ran Card)
<li>Did I really have us five in mind when I was writing? (Ran Card)
<li>But you taught me that that was the wrong thing to do, that I shouldn't just sit back and watch... And I told Ran what was on my mind... Not in the most graceful manner, but I did. (Moca Card)
<li>A lot has happened, but Afterglow is still here. Ran has willingly changed so that we wouldn't have to... But, yet again, she's the only one struggling through hard times. (Moca Card)
<li>... I was unable to do what you told me in the end, and now... everything is a complete mess. (Moca Card)
<li>I've always had a lot of respect for Ran-chan, ever since we were little girls. Even as a kid, she held her own opinions. It was so cool how put together and tough she was... (Tsugu Card)
<li>I've been trying to catch up to her ever since. But now... I feel like I'm losing sight of her... None of us can understand her lyrics... or her, for that matter... (Tsugu Card)
<li>With every challenge, she learns something new, and she takes that and turns it into lyrics or music... She's so amazing! (Tsugu Card)
<li>I thought that, maybe, if I come to understand the things that are near and dear to her... I'd have a better chance of catching up to her. (Tsugu Card)
<li>Ran-chan, I'm almost there! Just a little further... and we may be looking at the same sky, once again. (Tsugu Card)
<li>I can't come up with anything. I don't understand anything, so I can't write anything. (Ran Card)
<li>If only I had kept what I said to myself... (Himari Card)
<li>... I wonder if Ran still enjoys the sunset. (Tomoe Card)
<li>When I look at us now, I wonder if we all see the same thing when we gaze at the sky. I wonder if Ran... if you all like to watch the sun set... (Tomoe Card)
<li>What if everything just keeps changing...? (Tomoe Card)
<li>If you don't wanna change, just stay the way you are! (Himari Card)
<li>I mean if there are things you don't plan on changing, then there's no need to force them to! (Himari Card)
<li>C'mon! Do you see how pretty this sunset is? No one should be allowed to miss this! (Himari Card)
<li>As I think about it, I realize change is scary for me. So instead, I'll protect the things that need to stay the same. (Tomoe Card)
<li>You're the reason I'm the person I am today. (Ran Card)
<li>That world you're looking at right now... I want to see it too one day. Until then, I'll be chasing right after you! (Tsugu Card)
<li>I-it's just...! Ran is so awesome... (Himari Card)
<li>I know the Ran I've been looking at is one that was frozen in time. Maybe I couldn't accept that you were changing and, at some point, started pretending like I couldn't see what was happening. But I think I've finally laid my eyes on the person you are now. You've become so cool and strong... (Himari Card)
<li>Yep. You're looking a bit cooler yourself, Tomoe. (Ran Card)
<li>Ran, don't go too far ahead and leave little Moca-chan behind now~. I'll be so lonely~. (Moca Card)
<li>I can finally get back to taking care of business as Himari, the leader of Afterglow. (Himari Card)
<li>I reserve our spot in concerts, schedule our time at the studio, and all sorts of things while Moca teases me... That's my 'same as always.' (Himari,
<li>I wanna write these lyrics together. (Ran Card)
<li>Hmm... Being childhood friends sure is tough~. (Moca Card)
<li>Right. Thanks for always being by my side. (Ran Card)
<li>What is 'the same as always'? (Moca Card)
<li>I hope this becomes part of our new 'same as always.' (Moca Card)
<li>The sunrise and sunset are pretty similar. ... I guess that's obvious though. (Ran Card)
<li>I gotta get a picture! (Himari Card)
<li>You might say our 'same as always' is the same as the sky. (Ran Card)
<li>Without us realizing it, our 'same as always' changed. I think it's like how the sky transforms little by little as time passes. (Ran Card)
<li>I wanna write the kind of lyrics... that will leave our new 'same as always' etched within our hearts forever. (Ran Card)
<li>The sunrise is really pretty. It has a much softer color than the sunset. (Ran Card)
<li>... Seriously, you guys always come through for me. (Ran Card)
<li>Just so that, at the very least, we won't lose sight of you. So that we won't fall so far behind that we can't reach you. (Moca Card)
<li>Our skies will always be connected. That's what 'the same as always' means. (Ran Card)
<li>I always knew being with all of you is what made me the happiest! And so, I've decided. I'll continue to chase after Ran, no regrets. This is the path I've chosen. (Moca Card)
<li>This song will finish, the night will end, and the sun will rise. Our new 'same as always' will begin. Thanks for everything, you guys. I hope you'll all continue being there for me. (Moca Card)
<li>We've never been more in tune with each other than we are now. I can tell! We're all finally looking at the same sky. Ohhh... I think I might cry~! (Himari Card)
<li>I wanna remember and treasure this view! That's something I have to do as the leader of Afterglow! You guys, we're gonna be together for a long time to come, you hear?! (Himari Card)
<li>We're watching Ran walk beyond our reach. She writes lyrics beyond our understanding... It all made me feel uneasy at first. But now... I'm not afraid at all! I have no reason to be... (Tomoe Card)
<li>Not when the entire sky is tied together by the glow of the sunset... There's nothing to be nervous about when I think about it that way. As long as this sky is above us, there's no tearing us apart! (Tomoe Card)
<li>Ever since we started this band... I've had a view of everyone's back. I've continued to chase you all so that I could keep up... (Tsugu Card)
<li>That's how I know that when I watch you all right now, this is the coolest you've ever looked and the brightest you've ever shone! And I hope you guys don't mind, but I'm going to keep on chasing you all for as long as I can! (Tsugu Card)
<li>I wanna keep singing! I wanna keep performing! I'm standing here today because you all create the sound that pushes me forward. (Ran Card)
<li>Even before we started the band... you guys have given me the encouragement and the support I've needed... I don't even know if I can do anything on my own... (Ran Card)
<li>But I want us to be together forever... And that's why I will accept your help and use it to keep moving forward. So please... (Ran Card)
<li>Put your trust in me, and follow my lead!! (Ran Card)
<li>I was thinking about how happy I am to be able to call you all my childhood friends... (Himari Card)
<li>I am who I am now because you've all been there for me. When I think about that, it makes me want us to be together for as long as we can. (Ran Card)
<li>I could see you all from where I was, so I know. Everyone was the coolest they've ever been! (Tsugu Card)
<li>Hey, hey, hoh! (Himari Card)
